This is my personal Portfoilo build in a Single Page Application (SPA). With the use of Angular.js, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML and PHP, the webpage is compatable for all the browser and most recent mobile devices. All data are comming from JSON file and nothing is hardcoded. The main purpose is to let the user know about myself and make their experience more user friendly.
